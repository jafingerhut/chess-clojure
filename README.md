# chess-clojure

Implementation of program that calculates the number of solutions to
an N-queens problem, translated from a similar version written in
Scala.  Both Scala and original Clojure versions were written by Paul
Butcher.  Modifications to Clojure program for investigating alternate
hash functions by Andy Fingerhut.

## Usage

Run `lein run help` for help on command line options.  `lein run all`
takes about 9 minutes on a 3 GHz Intel Xeon with Clojure 1.5.1 and JDK
1.6.0_65.
